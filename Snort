Snort

Snort have three modes: sniffer mode,packer logger mode, NIDS mode

sniffer mode: It simply reads the packets off the netwrok and display in the console
packet logger mode: logs the packet to disk
NIDS mode : which performs detection and analysis on network traffic

To start snort in packet sniffer mode: ./snort -v
To start snort in Packet logger mode: ./snort -dev -1 ./log (to specify a network use ./snort -dev -1 ./log -h 192.1682.0/24)
for binary mode logging use: ./snort -1 ./log -b 

To start the snort in NIDS mode : ./snort -dev -1 ./log -h 192.168.0.1/24 -c snort.conf  (it will apply the rules from snort.conf)

In NIDS mode there are different modes: 

-A fast : for fast alert mode simply alert with timestamp,alert message,source and destinatio IP ports.(./snort -c snort.conf -A fast -h 192.168.0.2/24)

To log packets in tcp dump format use: ./snort -b -A fast -c snort.conf

To read pcap file : snort -r file.pcap

If you place the snort in INline mode it will act as IPS: snort -Q config policy_mode:inline , for passive mode(IDS) : config policy_mode:tap

By default order for the snort: PASS, Drop, Alert,Log

alert tcp any any -> 192.168.2.0/24 111(content:"|00 01 86 a5|"; msg: "mounted access";)

Rule action : alert
rule protocol :tcp
rule format direction: ->
Rule ip address: 192.168.2.0/24
rule port: 111
alert message: "|00 01 86 a5|"; msg: "mounted access"

Rule actions:
Alert : Generate the alert using selected alert methos, and log the packet
Log : Log the packet
Pass : ignore the packet
Drop : block and log the packet

Protocols:
TCP
UDP
ICMP

Direction:

<> used for Bidirection trafiic flow
example: log !192.168.2.0/24 any <> 192.168.5.0/24 23

-> one direction

Port numbers:
Range operator ":"

log UDP any any -> 198.52.5.0/24 1:1024 ---> it logs traffic coming from any ip,port to the destination ports between 1 to 1024
log TCP any any -> 192.168.2.0/24 :5000 --> it logs traffic from any port goint to ports less than or equal to 5000
log tcp any :1024 -> 192.168.2.0/24 400: ---> log tcp traffic from the well known ports to the going to ports greater than or equal to 400


! ---> port negotiation

log tcp any any -> 192.168.2.0/24 !6000:6010  --- > logs an alert if it not in this port range


Even we can specify multiple ip address by [192.168.3.5,192.158.65.5,192.168.2.0/24]
